# AttuneHelper

~~A simple addon to add some QOL for attunements~~

## THIS ADDON IS NOW DEPRECATED
Since Client patch 16 (multi-affix support), the default tooltips provided by the server show all the information that this addon did,
and with the addition of being able to attune multiple versions of the same item, the stat display is no longer relevant.

## Dependencies

- [SynastriaCoreLib](https://github.com/imevul/SynastriaCoreLib/releases) (Optional)

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/imevul/AttuneHelper/releases)
2. Extract to Interface/AddOns and enable the addon in-game
